            <p>The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) is an American manufacturer of collectibles typically licensed from films, video-games, sports, music, and television based in New Jersey. The company was founded in 1996 and has over 60 licenses for which it produces products. NECA was tasked with making Crash Bandicoot action figures to coincide with the release of the Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy in 2018, and produced their toy line from 2018 until 2019.</p>

              <p class=" font-bold text-2xl">5.5" Articulated Action Figures</p>
              <p>These figures, released in 2018, are hyper articulated and incredibly detailed. They went so far as to sculpt in Crash's fur in micro-fine hair details making him look very fluffy and a perfect match to his in-game counterpart. Despite the spectacular sculpt, the of the criticisms for these figures was that the paint job, which attempted to show highlights and shading, was lacking and instead made Crash look very patchy. They are fully articulated with 13 points of articulation including a stomach-crunch and ball-jointed eyebrows! Did you notice how we said 'sculpt' and not 'sculpts'? That's because the second, and biggest complaint of all was that the toyline only included Crash, Crash and more Crash! I'm all for collecting lots of Crash Bandicoot figures, but when they're all from the same line it does get incredibly boring. 
                <p>Unlike the ReSaurus figures each iteration of Crash used the exact same sculpt with a different head, adding relatively little in terms of originality and definitely not improving on any of the issues, such as the lacking leg articulation and aforementioned paint job. Still, for the avid collector, the world's second articulated Crash Bandicoot figure-line is a must. If you are thinking of only getting the best of the line, be warned that most of the figures are labelled 'deluxe', so don't be fooled!</p>
                  
                <p class="font-bold">The available <s>characters</s> Crashes included:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. cardstock 'replica' crate - This was the base Crash Bandicoot figure upon which all the others were created. Most collectors stopped here. [Released 2018]</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Deluxe Crash Bandicoot With Jet Board</strong> - inc. Jet Board (2pcs - board and engine) - Unlike the ReSaurus figure he unfortunately doesn't mount to his board, which lays completely flat anyway, making it difficult to put him into any interesting surfing poses.[Released 2018] </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Deluxe Crash Bandicoot With Jet Pack</strong> - The same figure, but without eyebrow articulation...Oh, and he has a jet pack! The jet pack is actually incredibly well done. [Released 2018]</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Deluxe Crash Bandicoot With SCUBA Gear</strong> - The same figure, but without a jet pack...Oh, he does have SCUBA gear, though! Once again, NECA knocked it out of the park with the sculpt, it looks straight out of the game. [Released 2019]</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>'Ultra' Deluxe Crash Bandicoot With Aku Aku </strong> - This time you can rip off Crash's head and pop on a new one. All of the heads are from previous sculpts with different painted-on eyes. The heads are very difficult to swap, but the Aku Aku mask looks great and can sit on Crash's nose. [Released 2019]</li>
              </ul>
              <p> All-in-all this is a really great figure line. Yes, it would have been nicer to have some more characters to really flesh out the line, and for a long time fans speculated that perhaps this line was intended to only pay homage to Crash's different outfits and vehicles, but that wasn't the case...</p>

                <p class=" font-bold text-2xl">Unreleased Prototypes</p>
                <p>For Toy Fare 2019 NECA revealed their upcoming projects. Those projects included two new figure for the Crash Bandicoot line, Dr. Neo Cortex and Coco Bandicoot!</p>
                <p>Naturally fans were losing their minds over this, as it was finally confirmation that the NECA line was going to be a full-blown figure line with other characters, just like ReSaurus had been. However, it wasn't to be. NECA never released these figures, and announced the end of their Crash Bandicoot line shortly after.  </p>
                  <p>Of course this left fans heart-broken, but I'm sure those who had worked tirelessly on the line at NECA were even more heart-broken. One curious fan inquired as to why this was and was given this response on X.com:</p>
                  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We prototyped more but line didnâ€™t receive the support needed <a href="https://t.co/jtRbiaS8w4">https://t.co/jtRbiaS8w4</a></p>&mdash; NECA (@NECA_TOYS) <a href="https://twitter.com/NECA_TOYS/status/1192180771328610304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                 <p>So, it's clear that the NECA Crash Bandicoot line hadn't sold as well as they'd hoped. Who knows what kind of characters we may have seen had the line been more commercially successful?</p>
                 <p>It's worth noting that many fans were quite outraged by this response, as if they were to blame. Many fans felt like this was NECA's own doing as there was little fun collecting a toyline that featured the same character again and again and again.</p>
                 
                 <p> The figures seen in Toy Fare would have been resin prototypes created locally, so it is unknown if any steel moulds were created for mass-production. Hopefully someday these resin figures resurface or enter the collector's market so that we can get a better look at them!</p>
