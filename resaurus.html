            ReSaurus, famous for their videogame inspired action figures was a toy company founded in 1993 by Doug Sapp, a former student at Columbus College of Art and Design. The company mainly got their start doing tie-in hand puppets for movies like Flipper, Babe, and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In their later years, they mainly did action figures based on video games and animated series. They once sold $1,000 miniature replicas of the guitar that Ace Frehley used in KISS, though the guitarist himself was not happy with the decision as he did not give them the permission to do so and filed a lawsuit against them where he asked for triple damages of at least $400,000. In order to secure the license for Crash Bandicoot they were also forced to take on and produce figures for the 'Virus' movie. The movie, and consequently the toy line, flopped. Resaurus would later go out of business in 2001 and its founder Mr. Sapp would become CEO of Ncom, an Internet company that provides business-to-consumer services.

                <p>The first series of 1/10 scale figures was released in 1998 and featured characters from Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. This was the first time the characters had been imagined in realistic detail. They came with a variety of accessories including fruit, crates and weapons! They also came in an array of sizes, with Tiny Tiger being the largest of them all. This kept the figures' scales accurate to the game.<p>
                    <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jet Board Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Jetboard, wumpa fruit, golden Aku Aku mask, green crystal and wooden crate (with sticker sheet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Jet Pack Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Jet pack and removable harness, wumpa fruit, Aku Aku mask, red crystal and wooden crate (with sticker sheet) </li>
                    <li><strong>Coco Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Laptop, penguin enemy, lizard enemy, wumpa fruit, blue crystal and wooden crate (with sticker sheet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Dr. Neo Cortex</strong> - inc. Rocketboard, ray gun, wumpa fruit, black power crystal and nitro crate (with sticker sheet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Komodo Moe</strong> - inc. Scimitars (x2), tail (to attach to figure), wumpa fruit, yellow crystal and nitro crate (with sticker sheet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tiny Tiger</strong> - inc. Wumpa fruit, purple crystal and nitro crate (with sticker sheet)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The first series saw record sales for ReSaurus, though the figures would suffer from quality control issues in China, resulting in brittle and often broken figures.</p>

                <br/>
                The second series of figures was released in 1999 and featured characters from Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED. This series saw the addition of Dr. N. Gin who was sadly missed in the first line of Crash Bandicoot 2 figures, and more varients of our favourite heroes in their brand new costumes! By this time ReSaurus had changed to an entirely new Chinese factory, in order to avoid the same quality control issues as before. Unbeknownst to them, they had just made a deal with the devil!

                    <li><strong>High Flying Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Bazooka, wumpa fruit bullet, scarf, rubber Aku Aku mask, clear gem, wooden crate and action base</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Dive Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Scuba Diving aparatus (4 pcs - tubes x2, oxygen tank, mouthpiece), removable scuba harness, subermisible, blue gem and action base </li>

                    <li><strong>Dr. N. Tropy</strong> - inc. Uka Uka mask (for Cortex), tuning fork, black gem and action base</li>
                    <br/>
                    <p>This was a remarkable new addition to the figure line. If you haven't heard of the Moto Crash and Coco duo pack before, that's because it was an online exclusive only available on the ReSaurus website, making it incredibly rare and valuable today.</p>

                <br/>
                The plush toys were released in 1998 alongside the Series One action figures. We've included them on the website because they're integral to the ReSaurus line, although they aren't action figures. These soft plushes have small white loops on the top of their head, around which a split-ring and sprung clip are attached. These clips came in both black and yellow.
           <br/>

           <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
              
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - Our hero comes with shorts and red leather gloves!</li>
                    <li><strong>Coco Bandicoot</strong> - Coco is the only plush with printed-on eyes. This was likely to make her look cuter, but makes her look aesthetically different to the other plushes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dr Neo Cortex</strong> - This is the only Cortex plush to date that accurately reflects his square head.</li>
                    <li><strong>Komodo Moe</strong> - Moe was an interesting choice for a plush, when Dr. N. Gin is a more popular character, however Komodo Moe's plump body makes the perfect soft toy!</li>
                   <li><strong>Bonus character:</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Fur Crash Bandicoot</strong> - This version of Crash with high-pile fur is not actually a variant, but instead is the first release of the Crash Bandicoot plush. A running change saw that the plush was overhauled into the newer version.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <p>During the 1990s soft toys were considered cheap carnival prizes by most, which meant that a lot of retailers weren't interested in stocking plushes. ReSaurus got past this by making these small but high quality plushes keychain bean-bag plushes. Each one stands at around 6 inches.</p>

          <br/>
          The 'Holy Grail' of Crash Bandicoot collecting, this keychain was released in 1998 alongside the Series One line of action figures. It is common in the toy business for retailers to ask for exclusive offerings from manufacturers to draw more customers into their stores. In this case KB Toys had demanded that ReSaurus create them an in-store exclusive if they were to stock the action figures. With KB Toys being one of the biggest retailers ReSaurus agreed, but they did not have the time or budget to produce a new figure for their planned release date. To meet Kb Toys' demands head designer Kenneth Lilly told the factory to take a batch of Jet Board Crash Bandicoot figures and attach a metal keychain to them, then mount it on a smaller version of the Series One card backs. This would be their KB Toys exclusive. The figure itself is a regular Series One figure, which makes it large, heavy, fragile and completely impractical as a keychain or even as a bag clip. Needless to say, the exclusivity, the fragility of the figure, along with the small quantity of these figures make them incredibly rare and sought after today.
