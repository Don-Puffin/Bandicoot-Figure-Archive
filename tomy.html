            Tomy Company, Ltd., trading as Takara Tomy in Asia and Tomy elsewhere, is a Japanese toy company. It was established in 1924 by Eiichir≈ç Tomiyama as Tomiyama Toy Manufacturing Company, became known for creating popular toys like the B-29 friction toy and luck-based game Pop-up Pirate. Whilst Tomy didn't produce any articulated action figures, they did produce a bendable figure line and a static figure line which are very elusive and incredibly hard to find.

              <p class=" font-bold text-2xl">Tomy Bendable Figures</p>
              <p>Released in early 1998 to promote Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, this figure line consists of bendable figures. These figures are constructed in a durable rubber with wire armatures that allow you to stand and pose them. They function as keychains as each one is mountained to a ballchain which also holds a character charm and the Tomy paper tag. The figures were originally in plastic bags and hung on a larger board in stores. Customers would then pull the keychain, rip the board and release the product. Despite being a Japanese company, Tomy really failed to make these figures look as cute as the Japanese renders at the time. The only good-looking character in this set is Cortex!  </p>
              <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dr Neo Cortex</strong> - The only good looking figure in this set, Cortex's proportions are spot-on, with his large head and little stumpy legs. Despite his odd stature he does stand surprisingly well. This may be the first instance where Cortex's hair didn't wrap around his head and instead only sticks out to the sides. He comes with a Dr. N. Brio character charm.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - The ballchain mount on the top of his head makes him look a bit like a Telly-Tubby...A shocked Telly-Tubby! He comes with an Aku Aku character charm. </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Coco Bandicoot</strong> - Coco is very top-heavy due to her large ponytail, but her details are surprisingly accurate. Note that the Japanese version of Coco was regularly seen with brown eyes and a pink muzzle. She comes with a Polar character charm. Our version of Coco here is also in her original bag with her original paper tag.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Despite not being an articulated action figure line we had to include it on the website to spread awareness. Not many fans know about this figure line, most likely due to the fact it was never released outside of Japan and is incredibly rare today.</p>

                  <br/>
                  This series was also released in 1998 to promote Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. Unlike the keychains however, these figures are not bendable but instead are entirely static figurines. Released only in Japan, they came on colourful cardbacks that featured images of the characters as well as their character number. The plastic blister actually covers the front part of the card and wraps around the back where it is taped together. There are only only 3 figures, on 2 cardbacks, to collect in this set. 
             <br/>
             <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - Figure '01' is Crash Bandicoot himself. The figure is a squashed and stylised version of the Japanese renders of Crash, these days it would be referred to as a 'Chibi style'. Crash stands with one hand in the peace sign and the other holding out a wumpa fruit.
                        <br/></li>
                        <br/>
                      <li><strong>Polar and Grin</strong> - Despite its relatively simple design, this is the only stand-alone figure of Polar produced so far. Polar is sitting down, much like how he is seen in the Crash Bandicoot 2 Warp room. No matter how many times I've pushed on his head, however, I didn't get any free lives! </li>
                      <li>You may be wondering to yourself <em>"Who is Grin? Isn't that Penta?"</em></li>
                      <li> Well, being made in 1998 this figure actually pre-dates the character of Penta Penguin. 'Grin' is the Japanese name for the penguin enemies seen throughout Crash Bandicoot 2, and so naturally the penguin figure here is given that name. Grin would eventually become the name of Penta Penguin's girlfriend when they were introduced in the second (and last) edition of the <em>Coro Coro Comics</em> Crash Bandicoot manga which came out on the 25th of February 1999. </li>
                      </li>

                  <p>Alright, it's not a figure, but if we're writing about Tomy Crash Bandicoot merchandise how could we ignore this?! </p>
                  <p>This large piggy bank, created in 1998, stands approximately 8 inches tall and is utterly adorable. This is the only item to date that shows Crash actually riding on Polar like he does in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. </p>
                   <p>Coins can be inserted through a slit in Crash's back, which then fall into the hollow interior. There is a coin stopper underneath Polar which when removed allows the coins to fall out. </p>
