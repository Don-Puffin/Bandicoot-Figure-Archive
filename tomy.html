            Tomy Company, Ltd., trading as Takara Tomy in Asia and Tomy elsewhere, is a Japanese toy company. It was established in 1924 by Eiichir≈ç Tomiyama as Tomiyama Toy Manufacturing Company, became known for creating popular toys like the B-29 friction toy and luck-based game Pop-up Pirate. Whilst Tomy didn't produce any articulated action figures, they did produce a bendable figure line and a static figure line which are very elusive and incredibly hard to find.

              <p>Released in early 1998 to promote Crash Bandicoot 2:Cortex Strikes Back, this figure line consists of bendable figures. These figures are constructed in a durable rubber with wire armatures that allow you to stand and pose them. They function as keychains as each one is mountained to a ballchain which also holds a character charm and the Tomy paper tag. The figures were originally in plastic bags and hung on a larger board in stores. Customers would then pull the keychain, rip the board and release the product. Despite being a Japanese company, Tomy really failed to make these figures look as cute as the Japanese renders at the time. The only good-looking character in this set is Cortex!  </p>
              <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dr Neo Cortex</strong> - The only good looking figure in this set, Cortex's proportions are spot-on, with his large head and little stumpy legs. Despite his odd stature he does stand surprisingly well. This may be the first instance where Cortex's hair didn't wrap around his head and instead only stuck out to the sides.</li>
                  <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - The ballchain mount on the top of his head makes him look a bit like a Telly-Tubby...A shocked Telly-Tubby!</li>
                  <li><strong>Coco Bandicoot</strong> - Coco is very top-heavy due to her large ponytail, but her details are surprisingly accurate. Note that the Japanese version of Coco was regularly seen with brown eyes and a pink muzzle.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Despite not being an articulated action figure line we had to include it on the website to spread awareness. Not many fans know about this figure line, most likely due to the fact it was never released outside of Japan and is incredibly rare today.</p>
