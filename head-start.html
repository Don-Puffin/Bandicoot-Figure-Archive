                  <p>Head Start released Wave One of their Crash Bandicoot action figure line, based on the <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</em> designs in 2022. Online leaks of the figures created an early buzz amongst fans, but the highly anticipated figures failed to stand up to expectations. The plastic is soft and easy to break, the limbs are very loose making the figures hard to stand, and the paint job is basic at best. This is definitely a toy line aimed at younger people, leaving hard-core collectors a little disheartened. The figures were originally released in Canada with packaging in both French and English. They then came to Australia and the UK with exclusively English packaging. Later on in 2022 Head Start released the 4 Pack Edition boxed set of figures.<p>
                    <p>The line's Canadian distributor, Imports Dragon, eventually uploaded an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IT44cIMai0&ab_channel=ImportsDragon" class="underline">advertisement</a> for the figures to their YouTube channel.</p>
                      <p class="font-bold">The available characters included:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Dr Neo Cortex</strong> - inc. Uka Uka Mask (and mask stand)
                        <p>Fans mocked the disturbingly cutesy smile given to Cortex, though it was actually a factory painting error where the red paint for his lip was applied underneath it resulting in a cartoony smile. This was ammended in the 4 Pack Edition.</li>
                        </p>
                          <br/>
                      <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Aku Aku Mask (with mask stand) </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>Biker Crash</strong> - inc. Akano Mask (with mask stand)</li>
                      <p>This was one of the more popular figures, as fans unable to get their hands on the elusive ReSaurus Moto figure could finally get one here.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>Coco Bandicoot</strong> - inc. Kapuna-Wa Mask (with mask stand)</li>
                      <p>This version of Coco has a yellow neck, unlike the 4 Pack Edition.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>Retro Crash</strong> - inc. Ika Ika Mask (with mask stand)</li>
                      <p>You guessed it, a total peg warmer.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>4 Pack Edition</strong> - inc. Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Coco Bandicoot, Limited Edition Golden Crash Bandicoot and Aku Aku mask (with mask stand).</li>
                 <p>When action figure collectors see a re-release of all of the previous figures in a multi-pack they know it's a sign that things aren't going well for the company and they're trying to shift product quickly so as to not make a loss. The Limited Edition Golden Crash Bandicoot figure is a nice collectable, but re-using moulds to produce cheap variants is a sign that the line wasn't successful and the company is hoping collectors buy for the sake of it. This would have been an opportunity to add the Lani Loli, the only mask from the game whose missing, to the figure line, but it seems they didn't have the budget.</p>
                    </ul>
                  <p> Calling this line 'Wave One' may have been wishful thinking, but it still keeps fans hopeful to this day that a 'Wave Two' may be on the way, featuring the rest of the cast. That time may have passed, but we're still holding on.</p>

                    <p>January 2023 saw another leak for Head Start when an Amazon listing for the figure was listed a few weeks early. The figure was eventually released in the same month. The Deluxe Crash Bandicoot figure stands at 7” tall and comes with two swappable mouths and two sets of swappable hands. Unlike the 4.5” figure this one features an upgraded sculpt with a stomach crunch, moveable eyebrows, more tufts of fur and more details added to his shorts and shoes. Crash also has an advanced paint job with more highlights painted over his body. Adding the extra tufts was likely necessary in order to hide the seam between the body and his swappable mouths. <p>
                        <br/>
                    <p> The figure was released in windowed box packaging that came with a piece of card to be used as a display stand. Again, this release suffered from having loose limbs. So far no other characters have been released in this scale.</p>

                      <p>Fans eagerly awaiting a Wave Two for the 4.5” figure line were surprised to see the release 2022 of two ‘diorama sets’ based on the characters from <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em>. The sets featured little in the way of a diorama background, and instead featured a set of smaller 2.5" figures and props. <p>
                          <p class="font-bold">The available sets included:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Boulder Dash Diorama</strong> - inc. Crash Bandicoot figure, boulder, ramp and mini crate</li>
                          <p>The stylised smaller Crash Bandicoot figure had 4 points of articulation, and the crate could separate in the middle.</p>
                          <br/>
                          <li><strong>Dino Dash Diorama</strong> - inc. Marsupus Erectus Crash Bandicoot figure, Marsupus Erectus Coco Bandicoot figure and Eggipus Rex figure. </li>
                          <p>The Crash and Coco figures had 4 points of articulation, where the Eggipus Rex dinosaur figure also featured a 'chomp action' where when pushed a spike on his back would trigger his mouth to open.</p>
                          <br/>
                          <p>It's questionable whether these two sets qualify as 'dioramas' as there are no sets or stands for them. The packaging does include a background piece, but this is standard in all of Head Start's windowed boxes as they all feature the same image. </p>
                      </ul>

                        <p>Released in March 2022, these 2.5" Smash Box Figures came inside large plastic crates that split in the middle. Once unwrapped, the box could be pulled apart or hit in order to release the random figure contained inside. Unlike the 2.5" Diorama Set figures, these were static figures with no articulation. Early leaked renders of these figures suggested that all of the villains from <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: Cortex Strikes Back</em>, however this was not the case.<p>
                          <p>Canadian distributor, Imports Dragon, released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7C0-ty5hUU&ab_channel=ImportsDragon" class="underline">advertisement</a> for the Smash Box figures on their YouTube channel. </p>
                          <p></p>
                          <p class="font-bold">The 11 available figures included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot Spin, Crash Bandicoot Thumbs Up, Golden Crash Bandicoot, Crash Marsupus Erectus, Coco, Dr Neo, Silver Crash Bandicoot, Silver Crash Bandicoot Thumbs Up, Bronze Crash Bandicoot and Bronze Crash Bandicoot Thumbs Up</strong></li>
                            <br/>
                        </ul>
                        <p> The Golden Crash Bandicoot is supposedly the rarest one of the bunch and therefore more collectable. However, lots of re-using the same moulds does not an interesting toy line make, and so fans were left disappointed at the lack of villains featured in this line. </p>

                          <p>Based on either <em>Crash Team Racing (1999)</em> or <em>Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled (2019)</em>, but featuring Crash as seen in <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</em> make this a very confusing toy indeed!<p>
                            <p>In true Head Start fashion the packaging features renders of both the <em>CTR4:NF</em> and the <em>CB4:IAT</em> characters, so we may never know. However, the RC car comes with an articulated Crash Bandicoot action figure and a few accessories. The vehicle itself is quite low-powered and is definitely a child's toy as opposed to a serious RC car. Unlike previous Crash-related RC cars, however, this one came with swappable wheels!</p>  
                            <p class="font-bold">The RC car came with:</p>

                              <li><strong>Crash Bandicoot in his racing kart, a wireless remote control, 4x Racing wheels, 4x Power sliding drift wheels, 2x Training obstacles and one wheel spanner (used for changing the wheels over) </strong></li>
                              <p>The racing wheels come already mounted to the vehicle, and the smoother, shiny powersliding wheels come as extra.</p>
